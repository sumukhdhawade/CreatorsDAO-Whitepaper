# Who we are?

A group of engineers and web3 advocates, passionate about education and technology.



We have been in the crypto & NFT space for a long time now. The one thing we have noticed the most is that a lot people support & understand the importance of blockchains, cryptocurrencies and NFTs in our world but very few know how to help "develop" the space.



Everything involving the development process can sound overwhelming but its really not. We want to help everyone learn, get recognition for their hard work and make it easier for them to pursue web3 as a professional field.
