# What's our vision?

### Education

We have been in the crypto & NFT space for a long time now. The one thing we have noticed the most is that a lot people support & understand the importance of blockchains, cryptocurrencies and NFTs in our world but very few know how to help "develop" the space.



Everything involving the development process can sound overwhelming but its really not. We want to help everyone learn, get recognition for their hard work and make it easier for them to pursue web3 as a professional field.



### Production

We want to help candidates with good skill sets in different fields to find their place in the web3 space. Web3 isn't just for developers, its for the people. Every project requires a team of people with variety of skillsets. We will operate as an RPO to find the best developers, creators, managers etc. for a project.



We also have a program to reward the freelancers and the projects they work it. More about this further. hint : ✨ work2earn ✨&#x20;



### Finance

We will be providing a lot of utilities & services, some free, some paid and some freemium.



Most of these will be holders exclusive, a lot of free stuff but if you are not a holder and are still interested in trying out our utilities or services, there will always be an option to go for subscription models. The subscription models will have the option to pay with USDC, SOL or ADNA (shh).
