We already have a huge IRL partnership. Details about this will be disclosed post-mint. To be upfront and not misdirect anyone, no details about how we will bridge this IRL business with web3 has been finalised yet. What we want to tell you is that we know how to do business and create partnerships, which is the most important part of running a RPO.



Anyone who wants to be a part of our RPO needs to match our standards by completing our courses and getting the required certificates or have a reliable work history which will be approved by our group of validators.&#x20;
